📌 Project Description

PasteApp is a lightweight frontend web application built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, designed for fast text and code input with a clean, responsive user interface. The project focuses on modern frontend architecture, efficient state management, and smooth navigation.

The application leverages Redux Toolkit for predictable state management, React Router DOM for client-side routing, and React Hot Toast for user-friendly notifications. Built with Vite, it offers fast development builds, hot module replacement, and optimized performance. ESLint is integrated to maintain consistent code quality.

This project serves as a solid foundation for building scalable React applications using modern tooling and best practices.
